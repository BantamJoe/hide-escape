Hide / Escape submission for the Unity ML-Agents Challenge


To have the project work correctly, install the TensorFlowSharp plugin available here - https://s3.amazonaws.com/unity-agents/0.2/TFSharpPlugin.unitypackage

(Just like one does for the official Untiy ml-agents repo - https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)

See this setup guide for more more detailed information on TensorFlowSharp and its setup:
